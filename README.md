# Rayinvr
The original author of rayinvr is Prof. Colin Zelt in the Department of Earth Science, Rice university. The source code is downloaded from [terra.rice.edu](http://terra.rice.edu/department/faculty/zelt/rayinvr.tar.gz) and main page of Rayinvr can be found at [here](http://terra.rice.edu/department/faculty/zelt/rayinvr.html).

Also a patch is done thankfully to Prof. [Scott Pearse](http://www.linkedin.com/in/scottpearse) who helped a lot to make rayinvr buildable in Linux.
